## Acquisitions

Notwithstanding condition E1 (Alteration of Risk), this Policy shall apply automatically to any new acquisition or newly formed subsidiary or associated company (but only where indemnity is already provided under this Policy for associated companies) by an Insured company during the Period of Insurance, provided that:

the Insured notifies the Insurer in writing:
1. immediately for new acquisitions or creations where turnover exceeds {{turnoverLimit as "0,0.00 CCC"}} or {{turnoverPercentage}}% of total group turnover declared at inception of this Policy, whichever is the greater;
1. within {{newAcquisitionsDays}} days for new acquisitions or creations where turnover exceeds {{newAcquisitionsTurnover as "0,0.00 CCC"}} or {{newAcquisitionsGroupTurnoverPercentage}}% of total group turnover declared at inception of this Policy, whichever is the greater;
1. within {{otherNewAcquisitionsDays}} days for all other new acquisitions or creations; or
1. at the beginning of any new Period of Insurance, if this is earlier than above.

the turnover in respect of such new acquisition or creation is declared, and additional premium is paid, from the time of acquisition or creation in proportion to the total turnover declared at inception of the Period of Insurance.

where such new acquisition or creation has activities representing a material alteration to the Business or is reasonably expected to increase the risk by means of frequency or severity of claims, the Insurer reserves the right to determine specific rates and terms and conditions for that new acquisition or creation.
